## ✅ **CONCLUSION**

**Core pricing infrastructure is NOW COMPLETE:**
- ✅ All tiers properly defined
- ✅ Stripe fully integrated
- ✅ Feature gating operational
- ✅ Usage limits enforced
- ✅ Dynamic pricing working

**System is production-ready** but needs UI components for users to:
- See their current usage
- Understand their limits
- Easily upgrade when needed

The pricing system will now properly enforce limits and track usage, ensuring sustainable unit economics while providing clear upgrade paths for users.
